## Overview

This trading app features a trading algorithm written in Python that uses Bollinger Bands to generate trade signals. The application collects live historical data using the `yfinance` library and executes trades through the Alpaca API. The algorithm is currently focused on trading the S&P 500 ticker, SPY.
